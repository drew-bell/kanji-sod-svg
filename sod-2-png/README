This program has the following dependancies

-- cairo
-- svg-cairo
-- libxml2

Currently it has only been tested on OS X 10.6.3.

This program takes one of the sag files from kanjisod.kicks-ass.net and alters it to desired style before outputting to the file to a png image.

This is a beta release! Use at your own risk.

To build the code if you have all the dependencies just run

./make

There is no install option yet.

For information on usage, see the help output from the program
./sod2png --help

The code for the rendering to png was almost directly copied from svg2png.
